			Comic Sans is a sans-serif typeface that was created by Vincent Connare and was released in 1994 by Microsoft. He created this font because comics originally used Times New Roman as their font but he percieved it as being too formal and not the aesthetic he was going for and thus Comic Sans was created to fit this aesthetic, being more literate friendly to the new computer users that would come to know the internet. Before Comic Sans, the beta version would be released but recieved backlash, this font was called Microsoft Bob and has a similar appearance to Comic Sans.

			Comic Sans was not officially released after it was made because he made it too late to include it in Microsoft Bob. It was finally released when programmers of Microsoft 3D Movie Maker which coincidentially used speech bubbles and cartoon guides. After that the font was used in OEM's system font for Windows 95.

			Comic Sans suprisingly got a recent update that happened in 2011, another person, Terrance Weinzier, who added different styles for the font. He added new italic variants, in addition to swashes, small capitals, extra ornaments and symbols including speech bubbles, onomatopoeia and dingbats, as well as text figures and other stylistic alternatives.
